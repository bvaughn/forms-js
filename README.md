# Forms JS

This is a seed project to get us started with prototyping.

## Installation

First install the command line tools globally with [NPM](https://www.npmjs.org/):
```shell
npm install --global gulp uglify-js2
```

Next install the remainder of the toolchain:

```shell
npm install
```

Now you can build source like so:

```shell
gulp build
```

And run tests like so:

```shell
gulp test:watch
```

Note that tests are run on *built* source so be sure to build first.
