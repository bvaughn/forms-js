# Forms JS

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/forms-js/forms-js.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/forms-js/forms-js)




This is a seed project to get us started with prototyping.

## Installation

First install the toolchain with [NPM](https://www.npmjs.org/):

```shell
npm install
```

Now you can build source like so:

```shell
gulp build
```

And run tests like so:

```shell
gulp test:watch
```

Note that tests are run on *built* source so be sure to build first.
